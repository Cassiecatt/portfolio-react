        <p>
          As a digital marketing expert who specializes in local SEO, I strive
          to develop impactful strategies for clients to ensure their business
          goals are met. I enjoy collaborating with various departments,
          learning new skills and being challenged to think outside the box in
          order to achieve. Some of my specialities include: Technical and local
          SEO, link building, IA design and restructures, content development
          strategies, relationship building and data presenting.

        <p>
          In an effort to grow my skill sets, I am taking a leap into the
          development world by pursing a certificate of completion through The
          University of Arizonaâ€™s Full Stack Development Boot Camp. My goal is
          to then pivot my career path and obtain a more development focused
          role. I am currently learning: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery,
          Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL and more.
